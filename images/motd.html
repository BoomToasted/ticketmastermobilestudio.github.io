			<br><i>"It's just amazing that the NC team was able to take the initial idea/concept, some technical direction from Nick, Carl and the TD team, and execute on those concepts without impacting any other company priority. At a time when 3PE, CCP-100%, and TradeDesk have so much going on, these guys really took the ball and ran with it."
