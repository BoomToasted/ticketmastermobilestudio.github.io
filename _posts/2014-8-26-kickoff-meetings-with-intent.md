Join Intent on Tuesday, August 26th for a discussion focused on the first, and arguably most crucial, step of a successful design engagement: the "kickoff meeting". The Two Toasters design team will kickoff the discussion by sharing a few practices and exercises, including one conducted with the group.

**Agenda:**

- Free Pizza/Drinks & Mingling
- Introduction: What is a kickoff meeting? Why conduct them?
- Practices and Exercises:
- Pre-Kickoff: Stakeholder Interviews presented by Darwin Campa
- The Priority/Feasibility Matrix presented by Will VanderVeen
- Design Studio presented by Adit Shukla
- The 20 Second “Gut” Test activity led by Dustin Rhodes
- Questions and Discussion
