User-centric companies aren’t born overnight—they’re built step by step by individuals taking the initiative to push forward new ideas and advocate for new practices. Our panel of experienced UX practitioners will discuss their experiences bringing new user-centric techniques and practices into their organization: how they started, how they won support, and how they built on their earlier successes. 

Panel Members

Julie Grundy: Bronto Software 

Mark Ferencik: McKesson Specialty Health

Brandon Houlihan: Ticketmaster Mobile Studio 

Melissa Eggleston: Lenovo (Moderator)
