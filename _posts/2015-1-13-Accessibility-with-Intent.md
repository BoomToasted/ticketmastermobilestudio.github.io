Join us on January 13th for a panel discussion on the all-too-important but oft-neglected topic of accessibility. We have a wonderful panel of experienced people, so bring your most burning questions on the topic.

We'll see you there! (Please note that the venue has changed, slightly—look for us in the American Underground Classroom, downstairs at the ATC.)
