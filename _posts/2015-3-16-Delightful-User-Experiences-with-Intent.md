Delightful user experiences: how to design UIs that are polite and forgiving, and have a great personality.

The user experience quality bar is rising-users are walking around with great UXs in their pockets, and they are starting to expect the same with their other software. Being good enough-solving problems with mechanical usability-is long past its "best by" date. Today, users want to enjoy using their software and feel good about it emotionally.

In this talk, Everett will explore what it means for software to be delightful and the specific attributes that help achieve delight. He will explain how to connect emotionally to users, and cover topics such as special experiences, personality, forgiveness, performance, and attention to detail.

The biggest surprise you will learn: just how little it takes to delight users. While their expectations are rising, they are so low that it takes very little to exceed them.
