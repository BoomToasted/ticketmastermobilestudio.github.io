It's been a while since our last event–those of us that organize this meetup got acquired, so we've been a bit busy–but it's time to get back in the swing of things with something new: our first networking event.

We've had a few of you ask us to create more opportunities to network, so we'd like to make that happen in a fun way. Most networking events throw you into a room with some booze and force you to schmooze for a few hours. We want to break the mold and try something a bit more structured and interactive.

Inspired by the 10/20s at Grok, we're going to separate you guys into 7-10 person sized groups where anybody can propose a topic of discussion (you can talk about process, products, tools, or projects for example). After 10 minutes on that topic, group leaders will decide whether to close out the topic and move on to the next one or to continue on it for an extra 10 minutes. Then we'll rinse and repeat for a few more rounds with other group suggested topics.

We're hosting it at our office, so if you're interested in joining us, RSVP soon as space is limited!
