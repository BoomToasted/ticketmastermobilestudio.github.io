The first CocoaHeads of 2016! Join us at the Ticketmaster Mobile Studio office in Durham for a great set of talks, pizza, and a chance to show off what you've been working on. 

**Agenda**

- “iOS Accessibility, Episode I: The Voice Awakens” by Jay Thrash: The first in a series on improving the adoption of the accessibility features provided by iOS within our apps.  Bring your favorite headphones and join us on an interactive journey to harness the untapped powers of Voice Over.
- “Functional Patterns for Object-Oriented Apps” by Kevin Conner
- "Show and/or Tell" by You!

**After Party**

As usual we'll meet up after CocoaHeads for drinks and more discussion. Most likely we'll head over to Tyler's.
